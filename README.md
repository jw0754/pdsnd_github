### Project Title
Bike Share Data Analysis Using Python. Hooray!

### Description
This project analyzes bike share usage data from three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. Using Python and data science libraries such as pandas and numpy, it computes descriptive statistics to uncover popular travel times, stations, trip durations, and user demographics. The project includes interactive filtering by city, month, and day of the week, and allows users to view raw data samples.

### Files used
- `bikeshare.py` — The main Python script performing data loading, filtering, and analysis.
- `chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv`, `washington.csv` — Dataset files containing bike share trip information.
- `.gitignore` — Specifies files to be excluded from Git tracking, including dataset CSV files.
- `README.md` — This documentation file describing the project.
